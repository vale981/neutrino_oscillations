# Neutrino Oscillation Playground
This is a simple webapp that helps **you** to understand neutrino
oscillations. **Buy Now!**

_Just kidding_. It's just a plot of the neutrino survival probability
(initial state = electron neutrino) with adjustable parameters.

## See it in the Wild
Head over to https://protagon.space/stuff/neutrino_oscillations/.

## Libraries Used
Thanks to [mini.css](https://minicss.org),
[math.js](https://mathjs.org/) and
[chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org).

## Todo
 - [x] Make the initial state configurable (trivial...).
