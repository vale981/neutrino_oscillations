# Neutrino Oscillation Playground
This is a simple webapp that helps **you** to understand neutrino
oscillations. **Buy Now!**

_Just kidding_. It's just a plot of the neutrino survival propability
(initial state = electron neutrino) with adjustable parameters.

Head over to https://protagon.space/stuff/neutrino_oscillations/.

## Todo
 - [ ] Make the initial state configurable (trivial...).
